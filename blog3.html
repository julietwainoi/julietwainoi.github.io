  <h1>🌐 Getting Started with Terraform: Providers, Resources, and Data Sources</h1>

  <h2>🧠 Introduction:</h2>
  <p>
    In my recent Terraform learning journey, I explored some foundational concepts that are critical to managing infrastructure as code.
    In this post, I’ll walk you through Labs 03, 04, and 05, where I learned about <strong>providers</strong>, <strong>resource blocks</strong>, and <strong>data sources</strong> — all using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
  </p>

  <h2>🔍 Lab 03: Terraform Providers</h2>
  <p>
    A provider tells Terraform how to interact with a specific cloud platform or service. For this lab, I used the AWS provider.
  </p>
  <p>Here’s how I declared it:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-hcl">
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This ensures that Terraform uses a compatible version of AWS provider in the <code>us-east-1</code> region.
  </p>

  <h2>💻 Lab 04: Creating AWS Resources</h2>
  <p>
    In this lab, I created an <strong>EC2 instance</strong> using a resourc
